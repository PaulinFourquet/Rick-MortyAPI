# Rick-MortyAPI

## Description
This project is a web application that utilizes the public Rick and Morty API to list all episodes of the show, providing information such as air dates and characters involved. The application is built using a modern tech stack, including React for the frontend, and is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for exploring the vast universe of Rick and Morty.

## Key Features
Episode Listing: Browse through all episodes of Rick and Morty with detailed information.
Character and Location Information: Access comprehensive data about characters and locations featured in the series.
Responsive Design: While the initial focus was on the desktop version, the app is structured to support enhancements for mobile responsiveness.

-git clone <repository-url>

Install Dependencies:

## Design approach
The design process began with an analysis of the existing folder and file structure to ensure alignment with the project's architecture. Initial efforts focused on making fetch requests to the API to determine the data to be displayed. After successfully retrieving and displaying the data, the homepage was developed. Although Tailwind CSS was initially considered for styling, challenges led to using inline CSS for layout adjustments.
